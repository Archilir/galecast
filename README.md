GaleCast
========
GaleCast is a minimalistic weather forecast widget written in Java. The application uses OpenWeatherMaps API as a source of current weather data and icons, with data search performed based on city names provided by the user (current default city is set to 'Gothenburg'). JavaFX/FXML is utilized for graphical interface and the Jackson Project library to deserialize JSON packets.
